# Project-Proposal

I intend to build a page for my business, Essential Technologies

The page will have the logo in the top center of the page with a narrative of the history of the company and how we came to be. Below that there will be a number of sections for the different services we provide. Each of the services will have a header and a narrative along with multiple pictures 

A third component of the page will be a request for a quote with multiple questions regarding the client's project. The form may limit the type of project to a drop-down list which will include an "other" category

The fourth component will be a "Contact Us" page where potential clients can as general questions. 

A last component will be something for clients to leave reviews and links to Facebook page and Yelp for the purpose of leaving a review also.
